# Domain Generalization 

**Domain generalization**, **distribution shift**, **out-of-distribution** learning/generalization, spurious correlations. There are many different keywords for this topic so we group them all under the category of "domain generalization". 

See "[Generalizing to Unseen Domains: A Survey on Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.03097.pdf)" for a high-level overview. The figure below provides a visual representation of the problem.
